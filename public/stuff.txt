<h1>Tsunami Wave Reaches NZ</h1>
<p>A tsunami warning remains in place for much of New Zealand's east coast and the Chatham Islands as waves of up to 50cm higher than normal hit overnight following a deadly 8.3-magnitude earthquake in Chile.</p>

<p>The powerful quake, which killed 11 people and forced the evacuation of 1 million in the South American nation, prompted the Pacific to be on alert for rising waves.</p>
<p>Civil Defence said emergency management groups will assess their regions this morning but "unusual marine and coastal activity" could be expected for about a day.</p>

<p>"There could be continued unpredictable activity, ebbing and flowing and strong currents."</p>

<p>People in the coastal areas of the Chatham Islands and New Zealand's east coast should:</p>

<ul>
<li>Stay out of the water (sea, rivers and estuaries, including boating activities). </li>
<li>Stay off beaches and shore areas. </li>
<li>Not go sightseeing. </li>
<li>Share this information with family, neighbours and friends. </li>
<li>Monitor the media for updates.</li>
<li>Follow the instructions of local civil defence authorities.</li>
</ul>
